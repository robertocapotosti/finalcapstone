## About this project<br>
This is an example about how to implement a bookstore program in Python and working in the terminal; it was a compulsory task of a Soft Engineering Bootcamp provided by [HyperionDev organisation](https://www.hyperiondev.com/).<br>
It uses SQLITE3, so it does not need any exeternal database

## Python topics<br>
- Extensive use of Docstring for documenting functions<br>
- Use of SQLITE3<br>
- Use of Try - Except<br>
- Use of lists<br>
- Use of the module TABULATE for printing tables<br>
- Class color: printing to screen in color<br>
- Implementation of a function that read the user input and it tested it using a function passed as a parameters<br>

## How to run this project in Local Machine

The following are instructions for Windows, where I developped and tested the program<br>
- install Python<br>
- install the tabulate module using the command:

```
python -m pip install tabulate
```

## Usage<br>
The program creates a database in the same location where the program is executed.<br>
The main menu presents the options to Search, Add, Delete and Update a book.<br>
The update and delete options make the user able to search for a book and then do the changes.

This is a screenshot of a session, where the user is first searching for a book and then updating it<br>
